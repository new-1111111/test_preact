    Objection 1: How can you know who will pick up the
    phone?
</span>

<span className="mt-4">
    Answer 1: We use a combination of big data and
    artificial intelligence to build a pickup profile of
    each of your prospects so we know exactly their
    phone behavior.
</span>

<span className="mt-4">
    Objection 2: We already use sales force.
</span>

<span className="mt-4">
    Answer 2: That's great. Sales force is a great. Our
    software sits on top of sales force and fully
    integrates with the platform. All it is allowing you
    to do is reach more of your prospects that are
    currently in your sales system.

<span className="mt-4">
    Objection 3: What counts as a reach?
</span>

<span className="mt-4">
    Answer 3: A reach is when someone picks up the
    phone. It is not a voicemail or an operator.
